# Lunatech Airport Assessment #
This repository contains a simplified and **incomplete** version of the Lunatech Assessment made for the single purpose of
writing a blog post about our recruitment process.

## Tech stack
The chosen technology stack for this version is:
- Java
- [Spring Boot](http://spring.io/projects/spring-boot)
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)

## TODOs
As mentioned, this is a simplified and incomplete version, which misses:
- Proper tests
- Proper documentation
- 2nd Report (isn't difficult)
- Proper UI
- Pagination for long lists (Runways and Airports)
- And much more...
